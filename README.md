# Combining DMAIC and PDCA: A Methodology to Reduce Emergency Department Waiting Time
Our goal in this project is to measure the efficiency of the emergency department (ED) by quantifying patientsâ€™ experiences
with crowding and waiting times. Our critical to quality (CTQ) parameters in this project are 1) timeliness of service, 2) wait times, and 3) bed availability in emergency departments and hospitals. The objective of this project is to use the DMAIC Six Sigma methodology to propose a framework for improving ED throughput and reduce crowding and long wait times.
